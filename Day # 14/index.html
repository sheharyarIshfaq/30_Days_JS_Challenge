    // console.log(person,captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let captain1= Object.assign({}, person, {number:30, age:20});

    console.log(person, captain1);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
